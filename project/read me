For the project Iâ€™ve decided to pick statistical portal, the information was taken from https://statfin.stat.fi/PxWeb/pxweb/en/StatFin/ . The data in the project shows the comparison between birth and death rate amongst men, women, and total. There are 4 graphs, and all of them give better understanding to the user. In the project I used HTML, JavaScript, CSS, Canvas, Cycle for, Map function, fetch, async await. The data in the project shows the birth rate from 1990 to 2022; as well as death rate with the same initial age value.
After having a look at the chart, the user is able to see the correlation between for example COVID-19 and birth rate.
 According to statistics, there was a boost in 2020 due to Pandemic, but on the other hand the death rate has increased as well but in the subsequent years.
The data shows the real data and up-to-date information taken from the real statistical Finnish website. I expect to have as many points as possible, I believe the project is well done, and ready for the use. I would be more than happy to have more than 26 points, because the project took about 5 days, I gave it everything that I know, and also did everything I could.
I know it is pretty hard to get full points, so this is why I asked the number close to maximum relying on your own evaluation as a professional. I used HTML, JavaScript, CSS as the teacher taught us, and used my own modifications to the code. I really expect to be having a positive mark, even though I was struggling with weekly exercises, but I sincerely and rigorously tried to do my best. The portal is also suitable for mobile phones without any interruption. 
The implementation of projects allows to gain practical experience, build a portfolio, develop professional skills; the project work was a big challenge for myself, but with good time management and supplemental materials it feasible  and doable, but of course with bunch of mistakes and try-outs.
